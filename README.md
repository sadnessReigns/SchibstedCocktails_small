**Rant**

Apologies, but I was confused by the "3 days deadline, 1 hour expectation". So I decided to treat task as-if I am in an R&D stage, and create 2 projects (MVP and PoC) - first I gave myself a day of work, second I gave myself 1 hour exactly (minus 20 minutes). This one is second. 
I treated it like an interview live-coding challenge and myself hard time constraint of 1 hour (minus 20 minutes, since live coding entry point is not interview beginning, there is some talk and maybe few tech questions).
I tried NOT to be creative there, and just follow A/C as "dry" as possible. Even tho there was no precise A/C.

``Project Architecture``
- 
Sample project + a local SPM package. Since that's a live-coding style of code, the main point of it is to introduce a package and utilize it within the main project. Some things might be rushed, but that's due to genuine time confinement I put on myself so that test assignment aligns with "expected" timeline I received.

``Design pattern``
-
Simple MVVM. The goal of the project was to "beat" the task within the "expected" time setting, as-if during live coding session.

``What I'd like to change?``
-
**everything**
